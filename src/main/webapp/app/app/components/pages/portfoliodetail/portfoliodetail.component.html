            Once a business owner defined the needs to take a business to the next level, a decision maker will define a scope, cost and a
            time frame of the project.[1] The role of the IT consultancy company is to support and nurture the company from the very
            beginning of the project until the end, and deliver the project not only in the scope, time and cost but also with complete
            customer satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scope of a project is linked intimately to the proposed business processes and systems that the project is going to deliver.
            Regardless of whether the project is to launch a new product range or discontinue unprofitable parts of the business, the change
            will have some impact on business processes and systems. The documentation of your business processes and system requirements
            are as fundamental to project scoping as an architects plans would be to the costing and scoping of the construction of a
            building. The most successful business projects are always those that are driven by an employee who has the authority, vision
            and influence to drive the required changes in a business. It is highly unlikely that a business owner (decision maker or
            similar) will realize the changes unless one has one of these people in the employment. However, the project leadership role
            typically requires significant experience and skills which are not usually found within a company focused on day-to-day
            operations. Due to this requirement within more significant business change projects/programs, outside expertise is often sought
            from firms which can bring this specific skill set to the company.

            Software development outsourcing is just a tool to achieve business goals. But there is no way to get worthwhile results without
            cooperation and trust.
